        heading: "Founding and Early Development",
        content: `Vereeniging was founded after significant coal deposits were discovered in 1878 on the farm Leeuwkuil by geologist George William Stow. Coal was a strategic resource for early industrial development in South Africa, and Vereeniging was named after the coal-mining association that developed the area — De Zuid-Afrikaansche en Oranje Vrijstaatsche Kolen en Mineralen Vereeniging. Mining began here as early as 1879, leading to the town's formal establishment in 1892.`,

During the war, a British concentration camp was established in the area. Many civilians were interned under harsh conditions; the site now lies near the modern Vaal Works industrial plant, and a Garden of Remembrance commemorates those who died.`,

The town itself was proclaimed in 1949 and became municipal in 1952. Dr van der Bijl's vision included not just industrial facilities but also a well-structured town with residential areas, green spaces, and services for families.`,
